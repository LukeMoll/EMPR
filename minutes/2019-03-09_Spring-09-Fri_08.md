Team Meeting 09/03/19
===

<!-- remember two spaces at end of line to break onto a new line -->
**Chair**: CW  
**Secretary**: JP

**Present**: AB, CW, JP, 
**Apologies**: LM (was here earlier)

## Agenda
What's working  
Format for submissions  
Weekend last minute jobs  
## Minutes

UI has all the states, although not all the peices are working yet. As of time of writing, CW is trying to get a timer on the 7-segment display, but may not finish it in time
Serial server is working, along with send_dates.py. All ICs will have to be modified to integrate that over the weekend
PC side stuff isn't completed. JP to finish (hopefully), or at least get some test code to demo
Each individual piece (playback, recording, reading and writing to SD, serial) have working tests to demo if everything breaks like it did this morning

AB would like to remind everyone that for the software submission, you need two folders in a zip file: GROUP CODE, same for everyone
INDIVIDUAL CODE: the ICs - can have group code in it, but has to be clearly marked as group code in a different folder

<!-- ## Any other business -->

## Actions
 
AB to clean up group code  
CW to chase all the things we need for the report: have all the minutes been signed, are the test files in the test directory, etc  
JP to write some PC side stuff
