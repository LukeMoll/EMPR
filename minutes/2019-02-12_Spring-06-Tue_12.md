## Agenda

 - Go over what to do next 

## Minutes

CW: UI mostly done, but can't go ahead until the rest is done (did a nice generate name thing over serial)
LM: Still no joy with the Audio Board. He gets one more week to work on it before giving up and going to onboard audio
JP: Working on PC side stuff, talking to Chris about libraries (numpy, ffmpeg)
AB: Problems with the libraries, needs to fix before he can continue working
RA wishes to be acknowledged as team moral support, although she can't officially be a team member as she doesn't do CS

## Actions

 - AB: Fix libraries, funnily enough 
 - JP: Keep enquiring about libraries and learn how to use them
