<!-- remember two spaces at end of line to break onto a new line -->
**Chair**: AB  
**Secretary**: CW

**Present**: AB, CW, JP, LM  
**Apologies**: None

## Agenda
Go over what we've done  
What happens if we don't finish in time?   
Labs are too noisy (likely to get more so)  
Go over code of conduct  
## Minutes

LM: working playback! recording is the same concept, should be fairly straightforward 
JP: have changed some files to be able to playback, not really working (not like sine wave), did a bunch of tests on ui (see tests dir)
AB: got file system working, wants to modify the way we do serial (will have impact on the way ICs work, but should make them better/run several things at once)
LM: finished playback, got most of recording but it's being problematic (not great sound, hard to get more than 3 secs)
CW: Added playback and filesystem stuff to the UI, helped everyone understand how the UI works so that they could try and break it

What happens if we don't finish in time?
We've got most bits working individually (not much PC-side stuff cause they require file system stuff)
have the test files for all the individual bits as part of the demo - if they don't work in the ui, demo them separately

Labs too noisy:
deadline week means that labs have been super noisy (especially as CW and AB have sensory issues)
AB and CW asked yesterday if they could use crossrail, as that's quieter, worked in there today (helped quite a bit)
It would also help if some groups weren't as loud

As our demo is on monday, we want to have a close on the demo code (barring ICs, done in branches on Friday, when we'll have our final meeting)

<!-- ## Any other business -->

## Actions
AB: do his serial server mod thingy  
LM: Try and get more than 3 secs of recording  
CW: integrate Recording into the UI, debug the random errors that popped up when people modified stuff >:|
