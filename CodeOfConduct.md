Code Of Conduct
===

## Lateness
If a member is late to any pre agreed meeting (meeting, lab, lecture) they
should let the other member know within 15 mins (when reasonable) and should aim
to catch up any work they’ve missed. If a member is not present for a meeting,
they will be notified of any decision that may affect them, but not stuff that
isn’t relevant (they can catch up using the minutes)

## Differences
If two members have a difference, they should aim to resolve it reasonably. If
tempers have risen, then they should not talk (about the issue at least) until
they have cooled down. If needed, they can call on other team members to try and
resolve the issue, else call on the supervisors.  Let’s try to keep things civil
(no swearing or shouting when talking to other people)

## Bad brain days (individual)
If you need a break, during a lab, let someone know and take one. If you can’t
work on something at a specific time, that’s fine as long as you let others know
along with a timeline of when you can. Taking off and working individually is
also fine, but you should let the others know that that’s what you’re doing so
they don’t disturb you.

## Twoing
